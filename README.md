# SSH-Attack-and-Defense
A custom project experiment dealing with attacking and hardening the SSH protocol in my home lab. I deal with Splunk, Metasploit, iptables, and more.

The _**full documentation**_ for the project is found in the PDF file.

Below are a few snapshots of the project:

+ Using Metasploit to brute force into the target machine (my personal device).

+ Observing failed SSH login attempts in Splunk.

+ Receiving Splunk alerts about failed SSH login attempts.
